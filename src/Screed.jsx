            Servicing adolescents and adults expiriencing mental health issues
            such as anxiety, depression & trauma.
            My theoretical orientation is integrative. 
            This means, while I work primarily from a person-centered prospective, 
            I also borrow concepts and techniques from other counseling theories such as CBT, 
            DBT and REBT as appropriate.<br/>
            During our sessions, you can expect to be in a judgment free environment. 
            My goal is to assist you in finding the answers that help gain insight and instill 
            a sense of hope.
